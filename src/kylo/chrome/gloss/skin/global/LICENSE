Much of the source code in this directory is derived from the Gecko SDK
(various versions, 1.9.2 -> 5.0). Many of the files contain their original 
Mozilla license headers. Some of these files have been modified to affect the
stylistic layout of Kylo. Some files have been more or less replaced with same
or similarly named files. Many of the original files are missing a license
header. In the most obvious cases, the MPL 2.0 license header and Kylo copyright
preamble have been applied to source code that is original to Kylo.

The code in this directory is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public 
License. Where not otherwise specified and where the source can not be 
attributed to the Gecko SDK or to the Mozilla development group, MPL v. 2.0 
applies.  

TODO: Severely vet this directory and all subdirectories. Remove Gecko style 
sheets that don't apply to Kylo. Replace style sheets with 100% custom Kylo 
code. Fix all license headers.
