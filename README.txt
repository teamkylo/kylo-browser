Welcome to the Kylo Browser source code!
----------------------------------------
Kylo is a web browser based on Mozilla's Gecko SDK for use on computers 
connected to TVs. The on-screen controls are intended to be viewable from about 
10 feet away from a 32" or greater HDTV screen running at 720 or higher 
resolution. Kylo was originally designed as companion software to the Loop(tm) 
in-air motion pointer from Hillcrest Labs. Navigation is done primarily through 
pointer control, such as with a motion controller 
(ie. http://www.warpia.com/products/warpiatv-swp500) or a mouse. Some work
has been done to allow control with a standard Up/Down/Left/Right remote 
control.
