Welcome to the Kylo Browser source code!
----------------------------------------

Kylo is a web browser based on Mozilla's Gecko SDK for use on computers 
connected to TVs. 

Kylo's on-screen controls are intended to be viewable from about 10 feet away from a 32" or greater HDTV screen running at 720 or higher resolution. Kylo was originally designed as companion software to the Loop&trade; in-air motion pointer from [Hillcrest Labs](http://hillcrestlabs.com). Navigation is done primarily through pointer control, such as with a motion controller (ie. [WarpiaTV](http://www.warpia.com/products/warpiatv-swp500)) or a mouse. Some work has been done to allow control with a standard Up/Down/Left/Right remote control.
